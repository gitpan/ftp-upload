This is the ftp-upload distribution.  ftp-upload transfers local files
to another machine using FTP.  It's meant to be used by scripts and such
rather than interactively.  There's no user interface, the program is
controlled strictly via the command line.  It is disciplined with its
exit status.

The change log is in debian/changelog.  Other than this you'll probably
want to ignore the contents of the debian subdirectory, it contains the
files which turn the distribution into a Debian package.

The program can be installed in the usual manner:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make install
